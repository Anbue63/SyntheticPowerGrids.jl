# SyntheticPowerGrids

## ToDos
1. PowerModels.jl algo -> what is going on?
2. Offer a mixed version for the dynamics! -> Third Order Kumamoto nodes should not be consumers?
3. Fluctuations
4. Normal Form with different number of internal variables
5. Normal Form parameter calculation -> internally deal with the variation from the set points!
6. Add an option without line losses
